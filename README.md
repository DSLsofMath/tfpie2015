##Abstract
In this paper, we present the approach underlying a course on
*[Domain-Specific Languages of Mathematics](https://www.student.chalmers.se/sp/course?course_id=24179)*,
which is currently being developed at
Chalmers in response to difficulties faced by third-year students in
learning and applying classical mathematics (mainly real and complex
analysis).  The main idea is to encourage the students to approach
mathematical domains from a functional programming perspective: to
identify the main functions and types involved and, when necessary, to
introduce new abstractions; to give calculational proofs; to pay
attention to the syntax of the mathematical expressions; and, finally,
to organize the resulting functions and types in domain-specific
languages.
